- Hover over parts of the object will name the instrument parts
## Features
- Sidebar for Instrument list (to pick from)
- Reset orientation
- Access 2D playing feature using the computer keyboard (notes will have keys displayed on screen & animations when it plays e.g a shadow)

***an idea is to be able to export the midi to capitalise***
