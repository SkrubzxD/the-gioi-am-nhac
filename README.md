Basically will be an online model preview

## Use Case
- User will be able to preview the model
- Mouse will interact with object as the center of rotation in 3D
- Hover over parts of the object will name the instrument parts
## Features
- Sidebar for Instrument list (to pick from)
- Reset orientation
- Access 2D playing feature using the computer keyboard (notes will have keys displayed on screen & animations when it plays e.g a shadow)

***an idea is to be able to export the midi to capitalise***

## Techstack
- We are using Three.js & Svelte due to Svelte lightweight and 3D
